# Let's Build a Web Page!

## The Big Picture

- Getting to know the web
- Javascript basics
- Demystifying the Command line
- GitHub!

# Today's Overview

## Our goals for today are to:
1) Get an idea of what's going on when we visit a web page
2) Gain an understanding of how to see a web page from a developer's perspective through the lens of HTML & CSS.
3) Build the bones of our own web page!

## Let's get started...

### Tools:

If you haven't already
- [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjw0N3nBRBvEiwAHMwvNvW0f2iPctKU-wLVSLZo2oVRC_0GAhYZkJL0ePH2f3XS-TPq7h6hkRoC4MgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- [Download Sublime (iOS)](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203207.dmg)
- [Download starter files](https://ga.co/2JYsw3Y)




## What's going on when we visit a web page?
A web page is just a collection of files that work together in a cooperative manner that are intended to be read by a specific type of application called a *browser*.

The types of files that work together are HTML / CSS / Javascript. We denote these with the file extensions <filename>.html / <filename>.css / and <filename>.js
  
>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
It is useful to think of these cooperative file types as bones, skin, and a neuro-muscular system.

A browser (ie. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) is simply an application designed to read and run these types of files cooperatively.

- DB/ Server / Client 
- We will be in the *client* today and building towards our [simple web page](ga.co/responsive-web-page).
- Take a second to observe

## HTML
Let's look at our bones - What is HTML?
- Elements 
Anatomy of an HTML element:</br>

![<a> tag]()
  
- Boiler plate (<head><body> adding content)
- Other types of elements you might see
- Lists (<ul><ol>)
- Observe again with new perspective

Let's get coding!
