# Let's Build a Web Page!

## The Big Picture

- Getting to know the web
- Javascript basics
- Demystifying the Command line
- GitHub!

# Today's Overview

## Our goals for today are to:
1) Get an idea of what's going on when we visit a web page
2) Gain an understanding of how to see a web page from a developer's perspective through the lens of HTML & CSS.
3) Build the bones of our own web page!

## Let's get started...

### Tools:

If you haven't already
- [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjw0N3nBRBvEiwAHMwvNvW0f2iPctKU-wLVSLZo2oVRC_0GAhYZkJL0ePH2f3XS-TPq7h6hkRoC4MgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
- [Download Sublime (iOS)](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203207.dmg)
- [Download starter files](https://ga.co/2JYsw3Y)




## What's going on when we visit a web page?
A web page is just a collection of files that work together in a cooperative manner that are intended to be read by a specific type of application called a *browser*.

The types of files that work together are HTML / CSS / Javascript. We denote these with the file extensions <filename>.html / <filename>.css / and <filename>.js
  
>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
It is useful to think of these cooperative file types as bones, skin, and a neuro-muscular system.

A browser (ie. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) is simply an application designed to read and run these types of files cooperatively.

We will be in the **client** today and building towards our [simple web page](ga.co/responsive-web-page).

## HTML
Let's look at our bones - What is HTML?

**Boiler plate**

In order to present organized documents that can be shared and understood universally the community has devised a basic structure for a standard HTML page. We call this structure a **HTML Boiler Plate**.

An HTML Boiler plate is generally comprised of two sections:</br>

1) A **Head**</br>

```<head></head>```</br>

The ```<head>``` is where we place content that is meant to be unseen. It usually contains information or links to other files that the page will need to render correctly.

2) And a **Body**</br>

```<body></body>```</br>

...in which we place any content that is intended to be seen or rendered.

Our Boiler plate looks like this:

**What are html elements?**</br>

Anatomy of an HTML element:</br>
![anatomy](https://github.com/kevinBloomquistGA/instructionalInterview/blob/master/html_element.png)</br>

some other types of elements:</br>

![<p> tag](https://github.com/kevinBloomquistGA/instructionalInterview/blob/master/p_tag_class.png)</br>
![image](https://github.com/kevinBloomquistGA/instructionalInterview/blob/master/image_element.png)</br>
![<a> tag](https://github.com/kevinBloomquistGA/instructionalInterview/blob/master/a_tag.png)</br>


Another tag you will see **VERY** often is a ```<div class="our_class_name" ></div>``` tag. Div tags are our blank canvas or otherwise undefined element that we can use to organize our content in a neutral way or a way that doesn't have any underlying rules applied to it.

![<div> tag](https://github.com/kevinBloomquistGA/instructionalInterview/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202019-06-05%20at%201.49.38%20PM.png)</br>
